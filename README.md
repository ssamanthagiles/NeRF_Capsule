# NeRF_Capsule

NeRF Intern Memory Capsule is a web-based platform that transforms a single intern photo into a 3D memory using Nerfstudio. Interns upload a photo from a moment during their internship, from team lunches to intern socials, and our system reconstructs the scene into an immersive 3D experience. These “capsules” are displayed in a scrollable gallery, creating a shared, interactive memory wall of intern life at Microsoft.

This project blends cutting-edge neural rendering with storytelling, making it easy for anyone to contribute a memory and explore others’ experiences in a visually rich and dynamic way.
